## SUMMARY
In **Treasure Tactics**, you control a group of up to 3 adventurers pillaging a pirate infested island for treasure in a turn-based strategy setting. The goal is to fight as far as you can through the island and return alive before you are overwhelmed. Each time you return, you'll have enhanced weapons and abilities to grab more loot than the last visit and hopefully not be left behind. Death is permanent so don't be too bold or you may not see your crew return.

## PURPOSE
This project was a 30 day challenge to finish a functioning prototype for the month of January 2025. This year I hope to keep up this trend and finish 12 prototypes, 1 a month.

In the future, I hope to revisit this project for some polish (and a tutorial (and more levels than 1)).
